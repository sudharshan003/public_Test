Rules and considerations
You can add a route to your route tables that is more specific than the local route. The destination must match the entire IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block of a subnet in your VPC. The target must be a NAT gateway, network interface, or Gateway Load Balancer endpoint.

If your route table has multiple routes, we use the most specific route that matches the traffic (longest prefix match) to determine how to route the traffic.

You can't add routes to IPv4 addresses that are an exact match or a subset of the following range: 169.254.168.0/22. This range is within the link-local address space and is reserved for use by AWS services. For example, Amazon EC2 uses addresses in this range for services that are accessible only from EC2 instances, such as the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) and the Amazon DNS server. You can use a CIDR block that is larger than but overlaps 169.254.168.0/22, but packets destined for addresses in 169.254.168.0/22 will not be forwarded.

You can't add routes to IPv6 addresses that are an exact match or a subset of the following range: fd00:ec2::/32. This range is within the unique local address (ULA) space and is reserved for use by AWS services. For example, Amazon EC2 uses addresses in this range for services that are accessible only from EC2 instances, such as the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) and the Amazon DNS server. You can use a CIDR block that is larger than but overlaps fd00:ec2::/32, but packets destined for addresses in fd00:ec2::/32 will not be forwarded.

You can add middlebox appliances to the routing paths for your VPC. For more information, see Routing for a middlebox appliance.
